# Tic-Tak-Toe Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 17

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to create a single page app with linking as well as incorporating React components.

### Features

* A listing of books with details from each respective book.
* Links that are navigated to by using single page application techniques.

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the Single-Page-App directory to your local machine.
A local server is needed to run the test React applications.
To do this complete the following steps:
- Download Live Server extension in VS code OR
- Download http-server via terminal using `npm install --global http-server` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- Run a new terminal window within that folder and launch the React app via `http-server -c-1` 
- `-c-1` is used to stop the page from caching
- Once is it running, you can open your browser and navigate to the following site:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080     
- To quit the application you can use `Ctrl + c`

### Expected outcomes:
A listing of books for easy access.

## Support

If by some unexpected circumstance the books stop booking, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

- Same functionality but different data to be pulled.
